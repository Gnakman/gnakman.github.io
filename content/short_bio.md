### Short Biography

Since 2022 I have been working as an aerodynamics engineer at [Hyundai Motor Company](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en), where I split my time between method development work and aerodynamic development of HMG vehicles.

I attended the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/), obtaining both Bachelor of Applied Science and Master of Applied Science there. I started working on aerodynamics since the third year of my undergrad days, and I have not stopped since then.

Being an avid hiker, I thru-hiked the Pacific Crest Trail and the Colorado Trail. I also walked from Windsor, ON to Quebec City, QC. I think I hiked around 4000 miles around North America.

I was born in South Korea and spent time in Korea, Malaysia, and Canada. My family finally decided to settle down in Ontario, Canada.
I currently reside in Metro Detroit. I am fluent in Korean(강남균) and English(Nam).
