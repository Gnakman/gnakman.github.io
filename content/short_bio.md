### Short Biography

Since 2022 I have been working as an aerodynamics engineer at [Hyundai Motor Company](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en), where I split my time between method development work and aerodynamic development of HMG vehicles.

I attended the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/), obtaining both Bachelor of Applied Science and Master of Applied Science there. I started working on aerodynamics since the third year of my undergrad days, and I have not stopped since then.
