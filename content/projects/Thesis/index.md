#### Description

I investigated the effect of approach flow condition on the wake of an Ahmed body. Two different case was considered, case A had an uniform inlet condition and a fully developed boundary layer was specified at the inlet for case B. Bimodal behaviour of the wake disappeared once a fully developed boundary layer was specified at the inlet.
