### Short Biography

Since 2022 I have been working as an aerodynamics engineer at [Hyundai Motor Company](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en), where most of my time is spent on improving/creating new methodologies to enhance the aerodynamic development process. I also participate in vehicle development work and I conduct CFD analysis to help meet our aero target. 

I attended the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/), obtaining both Bachelor of Applied Science and Master of Applied Science there.
